The **New England Software Carpentry Library Consortium** or **(NESCLiC)** is an association of academic libraries, joined as a community of practice focused on building data science skills in research computing, and extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. NESCLiC allows member institutions to share in a Gold-level membership with the Carpentries. 


## What are the Carpentries?

The Carpentries' workshops are hands-on two-day events that cover the core skills needed to be productive in a small team. Instruction sessions are integrated with practical exercises, and all instruction is done via live coding (carpentries.org).

**Software Carpentry** workshops focus on automating tasks, how to track and share work using version control, and how to write software that is readable, reusable, and reliable.

**Data Carpentry** workshops are domain-specific, and follow a narrative structure, working with one dataset through the whole data lifecycle from project organization to visualization.
 
**Library Carpentry** workshops are designed to help library professionals. Lessons include SQL, web scraping, data cleaning and tidying. It is not formally associated with the Carpetries.
