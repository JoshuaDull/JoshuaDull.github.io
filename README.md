# NESCLiC Website
Fork of Joshua's Future home for the NESCLiC Consortium website work with intention of merging into existing site to make use of new yaml/jekyll/google sheets functionality. 

See http://kinlane.com/2016/10/11/google-spreadsheet-to-yaml-on-jekyll/ for more information about the tool to be used here, if we can get the automation running. And of course, if need be we can fall back to manually updating the yaml data files!


For more on the way you can use yaml to create Jekyll websites see https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/providing-yaml-driven-xml-json-and-atom-using-jekyll-and-github/
